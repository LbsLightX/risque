this is where i keep the tools i've built - small creations designed to make
development smoother, workflows simpler, and ideas easier to bring to life.

- [evergarden](https://github.com/everviolet/nvim) - a soft, nature-inspired colorscheme
- [ivy](@/tools/ivy.md) - a nix-based neovim setup
- [lynn.nvim](@/blog/neovim-native-configuration.md) - a lightweight neovim plugin manager _(work-in-progress)_
- [artio.nvim](https://github.com/comfysage/artio.nvim) - a minimal, nature-infused file picker for neovim using the new extui window

more tools are always growing here - check back later! 🌿
