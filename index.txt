hii! welcome to my site :)

im robin. im a software designer in my freetime and a sociology student at uni

welcome to my internet garden, a cozy corner of the internet for storing my
ideas and sharing what i'm working on.

in my garden you can find my /blog and documention for some of my /tools .

✨ i'm passionate about:

- software (neovim, nix, rust, and more)
- aesthetics (colorschemes, ui design, minimalism)
- nature & mythology (gardens, forests, folklore)

🌱 in my projects, i blend these passions together:

- evergarden (a soft, nature-inspired colorscheme)
- ember (a lightweight neovim plugin manager) (work-in-progress)
- ivy (a nix-based neovim setup)
